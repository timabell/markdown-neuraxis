## 🧠 What is `markdown-neuraxis`?

`markdown-neuraxis` is an experimental, local-first tool for structured thought, life organization, and personal knowledge management — all powered by plain Markdown files.

It draws inspiration from:
- 🧘 **GTD** and **Sunsama** for task and life planning
- 📚 **Logseq**, **Obsidian**, and **Tana** for networked thinking
- 📦 **Trello** and **Kanban** for flow-based task movement
- 🧠 The **PARA** and **Zettelkasten** methods for knowledge organization

And it's all held together by:
- ✍️ Plain Markdown files
- 🧩 A fast, keyboard-driven UI (coming)
- 🧠 A mental model that connects **goals → tasks → notes** into a coherent, navigable system

## 🧬 Why the name `markdown-neuraxis`?

> In anatomy, the **neuraxis** is the structural core of the central nervous system — the literal backbone of thought and action.

In this project, your **Markdown files** form that core. They represent everything: your notes, your goals, your tasks, your daily journals, your references.

`markdown-neuraxis` is about giving you:
- A **single, fast, local** system for thinking, planning, and remembering
- A digital nervous system you **actually trust** and control
- A way to integrate daily action with lifelong purpose

## 🚧 Current Status

This is the **early groundwork** stage. Nothing promised, but something is happening.

The goal of the **first working MVP**:
- Daily journal files in Markdown
- Flat Markdown files *or* bullet-outline wiki notes
- Folder support and hierarchy
- Backlinking + page linking (`[[like this]]`)
- Keyboard-first UX
- Speed and clarity
- Tabbed window views
- Optional query syntax for dashboards (`lead-status:: contacted`, etc.)
- Migration tool from Logseq (namespace → folder)

---

## 🌱 Why This, Now?

All existing tools either:
- Sacrifice local control (SaaS lock-in)
- Slow down (Electron bloat)
- Miss the glue between **task**, **note**, **project**, and **life purpose**

You don't need a new app.
You need a **markdown neuraxis**.
