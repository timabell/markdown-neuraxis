# markdown-neuraxis

**The central nervous system for your digital life, built on plain-text markdown.**

## 🧠 What is `markdown-neuraxis`?

`markdown-neuraxis` is an experimental, local-first tool for structured thought, life organization, and personal knowledge management — all powered by plain Markdown files.

It draws inspiration from:

- 🧘 **GTD** method
- 🌅 **Sunsama** for task and daily planning with clarity of mind and focus (props to the founder for such great thinking)
- 📚 **Logseq** for outlining and journalling (engineering notebook), plus many other cool features
- 📦 **Trello** and **Kanban** for flow-based task movement - see also "The Toyota Way"
- 🧠 The **PARA** method for knowledge organization

You will get more value from this tool if you have read the GTD book, the PARA method, and have followed the Sunsama journey.

It's all held together by:

- ✍️ Plain Markdown files
- 🧩 A fast, keyboard-driven UI (coming)
- 🧠 A mental model that connects **goals → tasks → notes** into a coherent, navigable system

## 🧬 Why the name `markdown-neuraxis`?

> In anatomy, the **neuraxis** is the structural core of the central nervous system — the literal backbone of thought and action.

In this project, your **Markdown files** form that core. They represent everything: your notes, your goals, your tasks, your daily journals, your references.

`markdown-neuraxis` is about giving you:
- A **single, fast, local** system for thinking, planning, and remembering
- A digital nervous system you **actually trust** and control
- A way to integrate daily action with lifelong purpose

## 🚧 Current Status

This is the **early groundwork** stage. Nothing promised, but something is happening.

The goal of the **first working MVP**:
- Daily journal files in Markdown
- Flat Markdown files *or* bullet-outline wiki notes
- Folder support and hierarchy
- Backlinking + page linking (`[[like this]]`)
- Keyboard-first UX
- Speed and clarity
- Tabbed window views
- Optional query syntax for dashboards (`lead-status:: contacted`, etc.)
- Migration tool from Logseq (namespace → folder)

## 🌱 Why This, Now?

All existing tools either:

- Sacrifice local control (SaaS lock-in)
- Slow down (Electron bloat)
- Miss the glue between **task**, **note**, **project**, and **life purpose**

Logseq is very good and incredibly complete, but moving to database-first and away from its roots as a markdown-first tool.

## Get involved, show your support

It will be a huge encouragement to my efforts if I know others think the same way, show your support by starring the repo (so I know you're there), adding issues and discussions, making suggestions, and posting about this in your favourite places to hang out online.
