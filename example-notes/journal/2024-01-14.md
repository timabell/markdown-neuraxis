## ðŸ’¡ Ideas & Insights

Reading about habit formation - key insight: **"You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems."**

This connects to why I'm moving from random todo apps to this markdown system. Need consistent, reliable system that works offline and gives me control.
