# Fictional Old Productivity System (ARCHIVED)

*This system was replaced by markdown-neuraxis in January 2024*

## What I Used Before

### Tools
- **Todoist** - Task management
- **Notion** - Notes and project tracking  
- **Evernote** - Web clipping and reference
- **Google Calendar** - Scheduling
- **Apple Notes** - Quick capture

### Why It Didn't Work

1. **Tool Switching Overhead** - Too much context switching between apps
2. **Vendor Lock-in** - Hard to export data, dependent on services
3. **Sync Issues** - Conflicts between devices, offline problems
4. **Complexity** - Over-engineered systems that required maintenance
5. **No Linking** - Couldn't easily connect tasks to projects to notes

### What I Learned

- Simpler is better
- Plain text is more reliable than rich databases
- Local files beat cloud services for core workflow
- Links between ideas are crucial for knowledge work
- Daily reviews are more important than perfect systems

### Migration Notes

Exported 2,847 tasks from Todoist - most were stale
Saved 156 important notes from Notion to markdown
Evernote had 400+ clippings - kept maybe 30 truly useful ones

## Key Insights for Future

1. **Start with capture habits, not organization systems**
2. **Use one tool for 80% of workflow**  
3. **Make it work offline first**
4. **Plain text ages better than proprietary formats**
5. **Perfect is the enemy of good enough**
