# Getting Started with markdown-neuraxis

This is an interactive tutorial - feel free to edit this file as you learn!

## Markdown Basics

### Headings

Organize your content with different heading levels:

# Heading 1 - Major Sections
## Heading 2 - Subsections  
### Heading 3 - Topics
#### Heading 4 - Subtopics

### Text Formatting

Make your text **bold** or *italic* for emphasis.
You can also use ***both*** at the same time.
Create `inline code` with backticks.

### Lists

#### Bullet Lists (Unordered)
- First item
- Second item
  - Nested item (indent with 2 spaces or tab)
  - Another nested item
    - Even deeper nesting
- Back to top level

#### Numbered Lists (Ordered)
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step
   1. Sub-step A
   2. Sub-step B

#### Task Lists
- [ ] Uncompleted task
- [x] Completed task
- [ ] Another task to do

## Task Management

### Task States (GTD-inspired)

We use specific prefixes to track task states:

- INBOX Unprocessed thought - needs clarification
- ACTION Concrete next action to take
- DOING Currently working on this
- WAITING Blocked on someone/something else
- DONE Completed task
- SOMEDAY Maybe later, not committed

### Examples in Practice

- INBOX Research productivity apps
- ACTION Install markdown-neuraxis on laptop
- DOING Complete this tutorial
- WAITING Response from team about project scope
- DONE Set up example notes folder
- SOMEDAY Learn advanced Zettelkasten techniques

## Wiki Links & Cross-References

Connect your thoughts with [[wiki-links]]:

- Link to other notes: [[2_Areas/Health-Fitness]]
- Link to journals: [[journal/2024-01-15]]
- Link to projects: [[1_Projects/Learn-PKM-System]]
- Future links appear differently: [[This-Note-Doesnt-Exist-Yet]]

## Code Blocks

Share code with syntax highlighting:

```python
def organize_thoughts():
    """Use markdown-neuraxis for clarity"""
    capture_everything()
    clarify_actions()
    organize_by_context()
    review_regularly()
```

```javascript
// JavaScript example
const dailyReview = () => {
  checkCalendar();
  reviewTasks();
  setPriorities();
  timeBlock();
};
```

## Quotes & Callouts

> "Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them." - David Allen

> **Pro Tip:** Use quotes to highlight important insights or reminders.

## Properties & Metadata

Add metadata to any page using YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: Getting Started Guide
status: active
priority: high
due: 2024-01-20
tags: [tutorial, getting-started, pkm]
---
```

Or inline properties in bullets:
- Task with metadata
  status: active
  priority: high
  due: 2024-01-20

## Daily Workflow

### Morning Routine
1. Open [[journal/2024-01-15]] (today's journal)
2. Review yesterday's incomplete tasks
3. Check calendar and add time-specific tasks
4. Set 3 main priorities for the day
5. Time-block your priorities

### Throughout the Day
- Capture thoughts quickly with INBOX prefix
- Update task states (DOING, DONE, WAITING)
- Link related thoughts with [[wiki-links]]
- Add context with hashtags (#home #work #phone)

### Evening Review  
1. Mark completed tasks as DONE
2. Move incomplete tasks to tomorrow
3. Process INBOX items - clarify into actions
4. Quick journal reflection on the day

## PARA Method Organization

Your notes are organized into four categories:

### 1. Projects (Has an end date)
- [[1_Projects/Learn-PKM-System]]
- [[1_Projects/Website-Redesign]]
- Things you're actively working to complete

### 2. Areas (Ongoing responsibilities)
- [[2_Areas/Health-Fitness]]
- [[2_Areas/Finance]]
- Standards to maintain, no end date

### 3. Resources (Future reference)
- [[3_Resources/Book-Notes]]
- [[3_Resources/Code-Snippets]]
- Information you might need later

### 4. Archive (Inactive items)
- Completed projects
- Inactive areas
- Old references

## Tips for Success

1. **Start simple** - Don't over-organize at first
2. **Capture everything** - Use INBOX:: liberally
3. **Review regularly** - Daily and weekly reviews are crucial
4. **Link generously** - Connect related thoughts
5. **Iterate your system** - Adapt it to your needs
