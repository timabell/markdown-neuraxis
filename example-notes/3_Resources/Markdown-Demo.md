# Complete Markdown Demo for markdown-neuraxis

This file demonstrates all supported markdown features in markdown-neuraxis, including standard markdown, Logseq-style properties, task states, and advanced formatting.

## Basic Text Formatting

Here are the basic text formatting options:

- **Bold text** using double asterisks
- *Italic text* using single asterisks
- ***Bold and italic*** using triple asterisks
- ~~Strikethrough text~~ using tildes
- `Inline code` using backticks
- Regular text with no formatting

You can combine these: **Bold with *nested italic* text** and `**bold code**`.

Line breaks can be created with two spaces at the end  
Like this line break.

Or use a blank line for paragraph breaks.

# Usage
for num in fibonacci(100):
    print(num, end=' ')
```
