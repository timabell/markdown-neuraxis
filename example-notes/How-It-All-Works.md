# How It All Works Together

*Understanding the complete markdown-neuraxis system and methodology integration*

## üéØ The Big Picture

markdown-neuraxis combines three powerful methodologies into one seamless system:

```
GTD (Capture & Process) ‚Üí PARA (Organize) ‚Üí Daily Planning (Execute)
                            ‚Üì
                    All in Plain Markdown
                            ‚Üì
                    Local-First & Private
```

## üîÑ The Daily Flow

### Morning (Planning)
1. Open [[journal/2024-01-15]] - Today's journal
2. Review incomplete tasks from yesterday
3. Check calendar for fixed commitments
4. Set 3 priorities from [[1_Projects/]] and [[2_Areas/]]
5. Time-block the priorities

### During Day (Execution)
- **Quick Capture**: Add INBOX items to journal or [[0_Inbox/quick-capture]]
- **Update Status**: Change ACTION ‚Üí DOING ‚Üí DONE
- **Link Thoughts**: Connect with [[wiki-links]] as you work
- **Take Notes**: Meeting notes, ideas, insights in journal

### Evening (Review)
1. Process INBOX items - clarify into actions
2. Update task statuses
3. Move incomplete items to tomorrow
4. Quick reflection on wins and improvements
5. Prep tomorrow's journal file

## üß© How The Methods Connect

### GTD Provides the Engine
- **Capture Everything**: INBOX prefix for unprocessed thoughts
- **Clarify**: Is it actionable? Is it a project?
- **Organize**: Into PARA folders and task states
- **Review**: Daily and weekly reviews keep system current
- **Engage**: Work from clarified actions, not vague todos

### PARA Provides the Structure
```
0_Inbox/        ‚Üê GTD Capture
1_Projects/     ‚Üê GTD Projects (multiple actions, deadline)
2_Areas/        ‚Üê GTD Areas of Focus (ongoing standards)
3_Resources/    ‚Üê GTD Reference (someday/maybe, reference)
4_Archive/      ‚Üê GTD Complete (done projects)
```

### Daily Planning Provides the Rhythm
- **Morning Triage**: Like Sunsama's daily planning
- **Time Blocking**: Cal Newport's deep work philosophy
- **Evening Review**: GTD daily review simplified
- **Weekly Planning**: Combines GTD weekly review with sprint planning

## üé≠ Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New Project Arrives
1. **Capture** in journal: `INBOX:: New website redesign project from CEO`
2. **Clarify** in evening review: This is a project with multiple actions
3. **Organize**: Create [[1_Projects/Website-Redesign]]
4. **Break Down**: List all actions needed
5. **Schedule**: Add first actions to tomorrow's journal
6. **Execute**: Work through actions systematically

### Scenario 2: Random Idea During Meeting
1. **Capture** quickly: `INBOX:: Use AI for code reviews?`
2. **Later Clarify**: Interesting but not urgent
3. **Organize**: Move to [[3_Resources/Tech-Ideas]]
4. **Tag**: Add `#ai #development #someday`
5. **Review**: Surfaces during weekly review if relevant

### Scenario 3: Urgent Bug Report
1. **Capture**: `INBOX:: Login broken for enterprise users!!!`
2. **Clarify**: Urgent action needed
3. **Convert**: `ACTION:: Fix enterprise login bug priority::critical`
4. **Update**: `DOING:: Fix enterprise login bug` when starting
5. **Complete**: `DONE:: Fix enterprise login bug` with notes
6. **Document**: Add to [[3_Resources/Bug-Fixes]] for future reference

## üìä State Transitions

```
INBOX:: ‚Üí (Clarify) ‚Üí ACTION:: ‚Üí DOING:: ‚Üí DONE::
                  ‚Üì           ‚Üì
               SOMEDAY::   WAITING::
                  ‚Üì           ‚Üì
               (Review)   (Follow up)
```

## üîó The Power of Links

### Building Knowledge Graphs
- Start with daily [[journal/2024-01-15]]
- Link to active [[1_Projects/Website-Redesign]]
- Reference [[3_Resources/Design-System-Docs]]
- Connect to [[2_Areas/Team-Management]]
- Review in [[journal/2024-01-21]]

### Emergent Structure
You don't need to plan the perfect structure upfront:
1. Start capturing in journals
2. Links naturally emerge
3. Patterns become clear
4. Refactor into resources
5. System evolves with you

## üöÄ Advanced Workflows

### Project Templates
Create reusable templates in [[3_Resources/Templates/]]:
- Project kickoff checklist
- Meeting notes template
- Daily review template
- Sprint planning template

### Query Power (Future)
```
query:: status::DOING
query:: due::[2024-01-15 TO 2024-01-20]
query:: tags::#urgent AND status::ACTION
query:: @waiting-for::client
```

### Automation Ideas
- Script to create daily journal files
- Git commit for version control
- Sync across devices with Syncthing
- Export to other formats

## üí° Tips for Success

### Start Small
1. Begin with daily journaling only
2. Add project tracking after a week
3. Implement areas after two weeks
4. Build resources over time

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- ‚ùå Over-organizing before capturing
- ‚ùå Creating too many categories
- ‚ùå Perfectionism in note-taking
