## üóíÔ∏è Project Notes

### 2024-01-15
Discovered that using task states (INBOX::, ACTION::, etc) instead of generic TODO makes a huge difference. Much clearer what needs attention. The distinction between "stuff" and "actions" from GTD finally clicked.

### 2024-01-14  
Started implementing daily reviews. Game changer for maintaining momentum. Template created in [[3_Resources/Templates/Daily-Review]].

### 2024-01-12
Initial setup complete. The folder structure makes intuitive sense. PARA + GTD seems like powerful combination. Next: build the habit.
