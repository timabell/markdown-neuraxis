- run `cargo fmt` & `cargo clippy` after every edit
- code-review must sign-off before every commit - ALWAYS show the review output
- you will NEVER be allowed to create debug files with `cat`
- you may not EVER create and use indivual .rs files and rustc for experiments. Use real TDD.
- don't run `git add` if the files are already staged, check the status
